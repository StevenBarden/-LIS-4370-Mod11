Precision Pursuit: Debugging a Tukey Outlier Detector in R

This repository contains my solution for Module 11 of LIS-4370 R Programming for Data Science.
The project debugs a function to detect outliers in a dataset using Tukeyâ€™s method.
It identifies a bug in the original code, fixes it, and tests both versions with sample data.
The fixed function correctly flags rows with any outlier, unlike the flawed original.
See the full explanation and results in my blog post at https://outlync.wordpress.com/.
